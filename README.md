# Creative Web Project
This is a full-stack creative web project coded from scratch using html, css, javascript, and vue. I also used tailwindcss just for fun. You can create an account, login, and upload photos to a database. I also got extensive experience using an Ubuntu/Nginx server to get the project on the internet. I made a droplet using DigitalOcean.

This is one of many projects created in my web programming class at BYU, so I also built about 10 other similar sites, which gave me great experience doing this from scratch and migrating it to my server. It gave me great experience using ssh to log into the server and using linux commands to navigate it.
